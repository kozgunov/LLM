# LinguaCoin
This codebase presents a practical implementation of the [architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554241) combining Large Language Models (LLM) with blockchain to
create a dynamic decentralized LLM system. 

Utilizing federated learning across a node network, it boosts model training and inferencing, leveraging user-contributed computational power and data. 
Cryptocurrency incentives ensure broad participation, addressing differential privacy and computational issues utilizing enhancing the LLM-blockchain integration.
This architecture also tackles bias and central control vulnerabilities in current LLMs, democratizing AI access for a more inclusive future.
It represents a fundament towards a scalable and secure language processing framework.
